# Our Links API
 
## Adding a Link
 
- Define the Resource
- Select the proper method (GET POST PUT DELETE)
- Define our "representation" - how we are going to pass data from the client to the server, and how the server is going to send us data.
 
```http
POST http://localhost:1337/links
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: bearer SOME_VALUE_YOU_GET_FROM_ANOTHER_SERVICE
 
{
    "href": "https://www.hypertheory.com",
    "description": "Best danged training available ANYWHERE!"
